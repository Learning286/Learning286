The Company’s\\nsuccess depends not only on the knowledge, skills, and abilities of employees, but also on sound\\njudgment, self-discipline, common sense, and integrity.

While the Company\\noperates in a sector which is at relatively low risk of slavery, unlawful child labor or human trafficking\\nexisting within the business and it considers its main suppliers to be at low risk of engaging in practices\\nof modern slavery and human trafficking, the Company remains committed to prevent the occurrence\\nof any such practices.\\nEveryone working for the Company is responsible for preventing, detecting and reporting modern slavery\\nif it is encountered. If you become aware of, or suspect, modern slavery is taking place, you must\\nimmediately notify Naviga’s Human Resources Manager. This applies whether or not the suspected\\nslavery involves the Company or any third party/contractor. The Company encourages openness and will\\nsupport anyone who raises genuine concerns in good faith under this policy, even if they turn out to be\\nmistaken.\\nThe Company will only do business with organizations who fully comply with this policy or those who\\nare taking verifiable steps towards compliance. The Company reserves the right to amend/modify this\\npolicy at any time.\\nAny employee who breaches this policy will face disciplinary action, which could result in dismissal for\\nmisconduct or gross misconduct. The Company may terminate its relationship with other individuals\\nand organizations working on the Company’s behalf if they breach this policy. If any part of this policy\\nis unclear, clarification should be sought from Naviga’s Human Resources team.\\n1.6 ANTI-BRIBERY\\nThe Company does not offer, solicit or accept bribes or kickbacks in any form and does not tolerate\\ncorruption in connection with any of its business dealings. Corruption is an abuse of power that involves\\nacting dishonestly or improperly in return for money, personal gain, or anything of value. It can take\\nmany forms and is not limited to interactions with the government.\\nCompliance with this policy and all applicable anti-corruption laws is mandatory. Failure to comply may\\nresult in disciplinary action up to termination of employment with the Company. As with all other\\npolicies of the Company, employees are expected to be familiar with and remain in compliance with this\\npolicy as a condition of their employment.\\nREPRESENTING NAVIGA\\nThe Company requires that each employee act ethically and lawfully in all business dealings when\\nselling, buying or representing the Company in any capacity. Bribery or corruption at any level is wrong\\nand will not be tolerated by the Company. The Company prohibits all employees worldwide and other\\npersons acting on behalf of the Company from giving, offering, soliciting, paying or receiving any bribe\\nor other improper benefit, regardless of value, in order to further the Company’s business interests.\\nBecause offering or soliciting bribes or engaging in a corrupt practice violates company policy, the\\nCompany will not indemnify individuals convicted for fines assessed against them. The prohibition on\\nbribery includes the giving or receiving of improper monetary payments, gifts, reimbursements,\\npersonal favors or any other thing of value. The Company also prohibits facilitating payments of any\\nkind without the prior written approval of the Chief Executive Officer. Any request or demand you receive\\nfor a bribe or other apparently improper benefit must be reported immediately to your supervisor and\\nNaviga’s Legal Department.\\nCompany employees must act in a lawful and ethical manner in all of their dealings on behalf of the\\nCompany and always avoid seeking or offering anything of value to improperly influence any business\\ntransaction or relationship. Giving or receiving a payment or gift that could reasonably appear improper\\nis not permitted. Company employees may not give anything of value in order to improperly influencethe Company’s business interests. Only reasonable and bona fide expenditures are permitted if, and\\nonly if, if they are directly related to: (i) the promotion, demonstration or explanation of the Company’s\\nproducts or services; or (ii) the execution or performance of a contract. There are some important rules\\nthat employees must follow:\\n• No improper influence or special treatment: Never give or receive anything of value to\\ninfluence a decision directly or obtain special treatment.\\n• No cash: Cash or cash equivalents (such as gift certificates, checks, or gift cards that are greater\\nthan nominal value) are not acceptable business gifts.\\n• Infrequent: Frequent gifts to the same individual, even if inexpensive, may not be appropriate.\\n• Transparent: Any gift must be given openly, at an appropriate time and circumstance—not\\nsecretly or through a third party.\\n• Understand local laws: Work with the Company’s Human Resources team to understand a\\ncountry’s local laws.\\nEach employee must make and keep books, records and accounts which in reasonable detail, accurately\\nand fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company. Employees are\\nrequired to report every expense accurately, regardless of its amount or its legality. Any questions about\\nthe propriety of a potential gift or payment should be directed to the Company’s Human Resources team.\\nGOVERNMENT OFFICIALS\\nIn terms of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the bribery of Government officials is condemned in\\nIndia. Therefore, the bribery of public servants poses grave risks that need to be evaluated closely.\\nFor the purpose of this section the following terms shall have the meaning as provided below:\\n(i) “Anything of Value” includes but is not limited to entertainment, covering or reimbursing\\nexpenses, investment opportunities, shares, securities, loans, or contractual rights, promise of\\nfuture employment, payments under consulting agreements, subcontracts, stock options, and\\nsimilar items of value.\\n(ii) “Family Member” refers to an individual’s spouse or partner, son(s) and daughter(s), son(s)-in-\\nlaw and daughter(s)-in-law, brother(s) and sister(s), step-brother(s) and step-sister(s),\\nbrother(s)-in-law and sister(s)-in law, parents, parent(s)-in-law, step-parent(s).\\n(iii) “Government Official” refers to:\\na) An officer or employee of any government or component of a government;\\nb) A director, officer or employee of any entity in which a government or component a government\\npossesses a majority or controlling interest;\\nc) A candidate for public office;\\nd) Any individual who is empowered to discharge any adjudicatory functions;\\ne) A political party;\\nf) A political party official;\\ng) An officer or employee of a private banking company;\\nh) An officer or employee of a public international organization (e.g., the World Bank or United\\nNations); An individual who is acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of a government or\\ncomponent of a government, an entity in which a government or component of a government\\npossesses a majority or controlling interest, a political party or a public international\\norganization, even if the individual is acting in such capacity temporarily and without\\ncompensation; and\\ni) Any other individual that discharges duties that are essentially public in nature.\\nNo employee should offer, promise, authorize, acquiesce in or give money or Anything of Value to a\\nGovernment Official to induce the Government Official to do or reward the Government Official for having\\ndone something desired by the Company or refrained from doing something disadvantaging theCompany. Ultimately, the conduct at the core of the government related bribery prohibition is the\\npromise, offer or giving of money or Anything of Value to a Government Official to obtain or retain\\nbusiness or secure some other business advantage.\\nYou must also approach with equal care payments and the giving of Anything of Value to the Family\\nMembers of Government Officials, largely because benefits given to the Family Members of Government\\nOfficials often can be construed, or misconstrued, as having been intended to affect the conduct of the\\nGovernment Official to whom the recipient is related.\\nPayments and the giving of Anything of Value by an individual or entity that has acted or is acting for or\\non behalf of the Company can pose the same risks to the Company and the Company’s directors, officers\\nand employees as direct payments and other value transfers by the Company’s directors, officers, and\\nemployees.\\nIf you or any other Company director, officer, or employee suspects that a Business Partner may be about\\nto engage in misconduct to benefit the Company, prompt action must be taken. That includes\\nimmediately notifying a member of the Naviga Legal Team of your concerns.\\nAGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, CONSULTANTS AND DISTRIBUTORS\\nThe Company does business globally with third parties, including resellers, suppliers, consultants,\\nvendors and agents. Third parties are expected to understand and comply with this policy and applicable\\nanti-corruption laws as well. Third parties also have an obligation to ensure subcontractors understand\\nand comply with this policy and applicable anti-corruption laws. Due diligence must be exercised in\\noverseeing third parties that are dealing on the Company’s behalf and all suspected violations by third\\nparties acting on the Company’s behalf must be reported immediately.\\nThe Company may be held responsible for the actions of third parties who offer or give something of\\nvalue to another person in order to benefit the Company’s business. That value may include the payment\\nof commissions or fees to intermediaries who are engaged in promoting the Company’s business\\naround the world. Prior to retaining any sales agent or other third party to act on the Company’s behalf,\\nan employee shall complete a Third-Party Diligence Checklist and submit it to the Legal Department for\\napproval.\\nFACILITATION PAYMENTS\\nThe Company’s prohibition on bribery applies to all improper payments regardless of size or purpose,\\nincluding “facilitating” (or expediting) payments. Facilitating payments refers to small payments to\\ngovernment officials to expedite or facilitate non-discretionary actions or services, such as obtaining\\nan ordinary license or business permit, processing government papers such as visas, The Company\\nprohibits any and all kinds of facilitating payments, except for very limited circumstances for which\\nprior written approval must be obtained from the Naviga Legal Department. However, the Company\\nunderstands that there may be circumstances in which a facilitation payment may be necessary in\\norder to protect against loss of life, injury, damage to property, or detention. If one of these exceptions\\napplies and you are not able to safely obtain guidance from the Legal Department, make or obtain\\nwhatever records are available to evidence the payment (including a receipt, if possible) and report the\\nmatter to the Naviga Legal Department, as soon as you are safely able.\\nIf you suspect or become aware of any act of bribery, recordkeeping or internal controls that you believe\\nmay be illegal, unethical or inappropriate, or otherwise in violation of this policy, you should immediately\\nreport the situation to your supervisor and the Naviga Legal Department. The Company will not permit\\nretaliation of any kind against anyone who makes a report or complaint in good faith with a reasonable\\nbasis for believing that a violation of this Policy or other illegal, unethical or inappropriate conduct has\\noccurred. If the act involves the conduct of an agent acting on behalf of the Company, the relationship\\nwith the agent should be suspended immediately pending an investigation of the matter.The following is a list of possible “red flags” that may arise during the course of business. This list is not\\nintended to be exhaustive and is for illustrative purposes only. If you encounter any of these situations,\\nyou must promptly report them to your supervisor and the Naviga Legal Department:\\n• Being aware that a third-party engage in, or has been accused of engaging in, improper business\\npractices;\\n• Learning that a third-party has a reputation for paying bribes, or requiring that bribes are paid\\nto them, or has a reputation for having a “special relationship” with foreign government\\nofficials;\\n• A third-party insists on receiving a commission or fee payment before committing to sign a\\ncontract with the Company, or carrying out a government function or process for the Company;\\n• A third-party requests payment in cash and/or refuses to sign a formal commission or fee\\nagreement, or to provide an invoice or receipt for a payment made;\\n• A third party requests an unexpected additional fee or commission to \"facilitate\" a service;\\n• A third-party requests that you provide employment or some other advantage to a friend or\\nrelative;\\n• You receive an invoice from a third-party that appears to be non-standard or customized;\\n• A third party insists on the use of side letters or refuses to put terms agreed in writing;\\n• You observe that the Company has been invoiced for a commission or fee payment that appears\\nlarge compared to the service stated to have been provided; and/or\\n• You are offered an unusually generous gift or lavish hospitality by a third-party.\\nThe Company’s management team and the Naviga Legal Department will monitor the effectiveness and\\nreview the implementation of this policy, regularly considering its suitability, adequacy, and\\neffectiveness. Any improvement identified will be made and incorporated as soon as possible. Internal\\ncontrol systems and procedures will be subject to regular audits to provide assurance that they are\\neffective in countering bribery and corruption.

This policy does not\\nform part of any contract for employment and may be amended at any time by the Company.\\nREPORTING VIOLATIONS OR POTENTIAL VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY\\nIf you suspect or become aware of any act of bribery, recordkeeping or internal controls that you believe\\nmay be illegal, unethical or inappropriate, or otherwise in violation of this policy, you should immediately\\nreport the situation to your supervisor and the Legal Department. the Company will not permit retaliation\\nof any kind against anyone who makes a report or complaint in good faith with a reasonable basis for\\nbelieving that a violation of this policy or other illegal, unethical or inappropriate conduct has occurred.\\nIf the act involves the conduct of an agent acting on behalf of the Company, the relationship with the\\nagent should be suspended immediately pending an investigation of the matter.\\nTRAINING\\nThe Company will conduct periodic anti-corruption training for all executives and employees and, where\\nappropriate, for agents and business partners.

These personal activities or interests may\\ninfluence the employee\\'s judgment, causing the employee to make decisions based upon the potential\\nfor personal gain, rather than in the best interests of the Company. The personal gain may be in the\\nnature of a financial or a non-financial personal gain.\\nTo prevent conflicts of interest, the following behavior is deemed unacceptable and unethical, except to\\nthe extent the law provides otherwise:\\n• Receiving or giving of merchandise, money, services, travel, accommodations, or lavish\\nentertainment that might appear to have been given to influence a business decision. Gifts\\noffered or received at any time that are of more than minimal or token value shall not be\\naccepted and shall be returned to the sender with an appropriate explanatory note or letter.\\n• Maintaining personal, business, or financial relationships with a customer or vendor when the\\nemployee has control or influence over the Company’s relationship with that customer or\\nvendor.

It is important to note that under certain circumstances, conflicts of interest can\\namount to violations of criminal law. Any doubts regarding a possible conflict of interest situation\\nshould be clarified with and resolved in a discussion with your manager, Human Resources or Naviga’s\\nLegal Department.\\nDUTY WHERE THERE IS CONFLICT OF INTEREST\\nWhere conflict of interest exists, the concerned person is duty bound to:\\n• Disclose the nature of such interest and benefits likely to be derived;\\n• Recuse themselves from any such meeting which may give rise to a conflict of interest\\nsituation;\\n• If the conflict cannot be prevented, the concerned employee should have an advance\\nconsultation with the Reporting manager and HR Manager.\\nRECOGNIZING AND REPORTING A CONFLICT\\nAny employee who is aware of possible violations should notify his manager. Here are some signs to\\nwatch for:\\n• You feel uncomfortable about a business decision or about something you\\'ve been asked to do;\\n• You have witnessed a situation that made you or someone else feel uncomfortable; or\\n• You feel the Company would be embarrassed, or face legal implications, if the situation were\\nrevealed to the public.\\nVIOLATIONS OF THE POLICY\\nViolations of this policy will be grounds for disciplinary action, adapted to the circumstances of the\\nviolation. Disciplinary action will be taken against individuals who authorize or participate directly in a\\nviolation of the policy. Disciplinary action may also be taken against any of the violator\\'s managers, to\\nthe extent that the circumstances of the violation reflect inadequate management and leadership.\\nCOMPLAINTS OF RETALIATION\\nIf an employee believes that he has been retaliated against for reporting information regarding\\nsuspected misconduct under this policy, he should file a written complaint with Company management\\nor with the Human Resources team.\\n1.11 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION\\nThe Company endeavors to capture the spirit of all applicable statutes and prohibits discrimination\\nagainst any qualified employee or applicant with regard to any terms or conditions of employment\\nbecause of such individual\\'s disability or perceived disability. A qualified individual with a disability is\\na person who has the skills, experience, education, and other job-related requirements of the position'"
