       " 'Please note that a performance improvement plan is purely to elevate the quality of the work output and\\nis in no way a reflection of the employee’s interactions at the workplace',\n",
       " 'As a general practice at a very high level, our approach is as follows:\\n• Before reaching out to Human Resource team (“HR”), the concerned manager is required to have\\na series of performance feedback conversations with the employee, during which the manager\\nwould seek to identify issues, provide examples and outline the impact and the expectations\\nfrom the employee moving forward. The feedback should be documented via email to\\ndemonstrate that conversations have been had and the employee understands the Company’s\\nexpectations from their role. The manager should provide coaching, support, training or re-\\ntraining as needed to the employee, and understand what barriers (if any) the employee is\\nexperiencing, or challenges being faced by him',\n",
       " '• If the performance issues are persistent despite numerous attempts from the manager to\\nprovide clear feedback, support and outline expectations, the next formal step is to reach out to\\nHuman Resource team to discuss. The employee should be made aware at this point that the\\nperformance concerns are serious and if improvements are not made, the next step is a\\nPerformance Improvement Plan (“PIP”). The PIP process should be structured in such a way that\\nit is not surprising/sudden to the concerned employee',\n",
       " '• To ensure transparency, the HR may request a ‘summary of coaching conversations’ from the\\nmanager. If the manager has not adhered to the process and given clear feedback, HR will likely\\nadvise that a PIP cannot be initiated and will coach the manager on what steps need to be taken\\nbefore a PIP can be initiated',\n",
       " '• If a PIP is being proceeded with, the HR will send the PIP template to the concerned manager',\n",
       " '• The manager will complete the PIP document and send it back to HR for review',\n",
       " '• The HR will provide feedback and based on the same, the PIP is finalized with the manager.• The manager will then meet with the employee, in the presence of HR, to present the PIP',\n",
       " '• The PIP document will then be sent to employee via ADP/e-mail for his/her reference',\n",
       " '• During the PIP, the manager should meet the employee on a weekly or at minimum bi-weekly\\nbasis to discuss progress and provide feedback and support. The summary of such meetings\\nshould be sent to the employee after the meetings',\n",
       " '• Two weeks prior to the end of the PIP, the HR will meet with the concerned manager to request\\nweekly summary emails and to discuss the employee’s progress. Both parties would evaluate\\nwhether the employee has been successful in meeting expectations, whether he has made good\\nimprovement, needs additional time, or has been entirely unsuccessful. The manager should\\nthen clearly outline to the employee near the end of the PIP where they stand against the\\nexpectations of them. To reiterate, the employee should be clearly apprised of information\\nregarding their performance standards prior to initiating termination',\n",
       " '• If the employee has been unsuccessful in meeting the performance standards, a discussion for\\ncessation of his/her employment with the Company discussion and process will thereby be\\ninitiated',\n",
